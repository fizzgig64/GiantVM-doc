QEMU supports very few architectures. Before Q35 appeared, only i440FX + PIIX, which was born in 1996, was struggling to support it. On the one hand, Intel continues to introduce new chipsets, and new things such as PCIe, AHCI, etc. have been developed. i440FX has been unable to meet the demand. For this reason, Jason Baron brought a PPT on KVM Forum 2012: A New Chipset For Qemu-Intel's Q35. Q35 is a chipset launched by Intel in June 2007. The most attractive feature is its support for PCI-e.

According to the Intel Q35 document, the topology of Q35 is shown in the figure:

![](http://illustration-10018028.file.myqcloud.com/20170717233926.png)

It can be seen that the north bridge is MCH and the south bridge is ICH9. The CPU is connected to the North Bridge (MCH) through the front side bus (FSB). The North Bridge provides access to memory, PCIE, etc., and is also connected to the South Bridge (ICH9). The South Bridge provides access for USB / PCIE / SATA, etc.


### Q35 Topology

So is the Q35 topology implemented in QEMU really as shown in the figure above? We query through ʻinfo qtree` in QEMU, and the simplified structure is:

```
(qemu) info qtree
bus: main-system-bus
  dev: hpet, id ""
    gpio-in "" 2
    gpio-out "" 1
    gpio-out "sysbus-irq" 32

    gpio-in "" 24
    version = 32 (0x20)
  dev: q35-pcihost, id ""
    bus: pcie.0

      dev: e1000, id ""
      dev: VGA, id ""
      dev: ICH9 SMB, id ""
      dev: ich9-ahci, id ""
        bus: ide.5

        bus: ide.3
          type IDE
        bus: ide.2
          type IDE
          dev: ide-cd, id ""
        bus: ide.1
          type IDE
        bus: ide.0
          type IDE
          dev: ide-hd, id ""
            drive = "ide0-hd0"
      dev: ICH9-LPC, id ""
        gpio-out "gsi" 24
        bus: isa.0
          type ISA
          dev: i8257, id ""

          dev: port92, id ""
            gpio-out "a20" 1
          dev: vmmouse, id ""
          dev: vmport, id ""
          dev: i8042, id ""
            gpio-out "a20" 1
          dev: isa-parallel, id ""
          dev: isa-serial, id ""
          dev: isa-pcspk, id ""
            iobase = 97 (0x61)
          dev: isa-pit, id ""
            gpio-in "" 1
            gpio-out "" 1
          dev: mc146818rtc, id ""
            gpio-out "" 1
          dev: isa-i8259, id ""
            gpio-in "" 8
            gpio-out "" 1
            master = false
          dev: isa-i8259, id ""
            gpio-in "" 8
            gpio-out "" 1
            master = true
      dev: mch, id ""
  dev: fw_cfg_io, id ""
  dev: kvmclock, id ""
  dev: kvmvapic, id ""
```


Note that dev and bus appear alternately, and a more simplified device diagram is as follows:

```
    bus             dev          bus     dev         bus       dev
main-system-bus - ioapic
                - q35-pcihost - pcie.0 - mch
                                       - ICH9-LPC - isa.0 - isa-i8259
                                       - ICH9 SMB
                                       - ich9-ahci
                                       - VGA
                                       - e1000
                                       - ...
```


Due to unfamiliarity with hardware and architecture, I have been studying it over and over again for a day before getting a little eye-catching. My understanding is as follows:

main-system-bus is the system bus. Ioapic is directly connected to the system bus, which is in line with our understanding of IOAPIC. In the q35 architecture diagram, the CPU is Core and Pentium Pentium E2000 series. According to the document, Intel has cancelled since Pentium4/Xeon The APIC bus is replaced by a system bus.

But what makes me entangled is, why does mch connect to pcie.0? By definition, mch is what Intel calls Northbridge. But the full name of mch is actually the memory controller hub, here it really refers to the memory controller hub.

Since mch is not a north bridge, then q35-pcihost is naturally it. On the one hand, host bridge is also called the north bridge. On the other hand, it is connected to the system bus and the pcie bus. Look at its definition:

```c
typedef struct Q35PCIHost {
    /*< private >*/
    PCIExpressHost parent_obj;
    /*< public >*/

    MCHPCIState mch;
} Q35PCIHost;

typedef struct MCHPCIState {
    /*< private >*/
    PCIDevice parent_obj;
    /*< public >*/

    MemoryRegion *ram_memory;
    MemoryRegion *pci_address_space;
    MemoryRegion *system_memory;
    MemoryRegion *address_space_io;
    PAMMemoryRegion pam_regions[13];
    MemoryRegion smram_region, open_high_smram;
    MemoryRegion smram, low_smram, high_smram;
    MemoryRegion save_blackhole, save_window;
    Range pci_hole;
    uint64_t below_4g_mem_size;
    uint64_t above_4g_mem_size;
    uint64_t pci_hole64_size;
    uint32_t short_root_bus;
} MCHPCIState;
```

And more verified my idea. Then the memory controller is uniformly numbered by pci, so it is reasonable to connect to pcie.0.

Similarly, ICH9-LPC is a PCI/ISA bridge, which is what we usually call the South Bridge. Then an ISA bus is connected to it to connect to traditional (Legacy) ISA devices, such as PIC.

### Device relationship
I personally think that there are two kinds of relationships, one is the mounting relationship, and the relationship between devices is defined by setting class object members. The other is the combination tree + association relationship, which defines the relationship between QOMs by setting device attributes.

#### Mount relationship

The device will be mounted on the bus. The call chain for creating a device object is as follows:

```
qdev_create => qdev_try_create => If the incoming parameter bus is NULL, then bus = sysbus_get_default() => If the global variable main_system_bus does not exist, call main_system_bus_create to create and return
                               => qdev_set_parent_bus => 设置 dev->parent_bus
```

Therefore, which bus a device is mounted on is specified by the parent_bus member of its DeviceState.
Here, main_system_bus is main-system-bus. Devices that do not pass in the bus parameters when created will be mounted on the bus, such as ioapic and q35-pcihost

Similarly, ICH9-LPC and other devices will pass in the bus parameter when qdev_create, which points to pcie.0, so it means that it is mounted on pcie.0, PCIBus

In addition, for the PCI device PCIDevice, although the parent_bus of its "parent" DeviceState has been specified on which bus it is mounted on, it also maintains a bus member that points to PCIBus. This member is set at do_pci_register_device.

The above defines the relationship between downstream device and bus, and the relationship between upstream device and bus is pointed to by the bus member of the device. such as

The PCIExpressHost-PCIHostState of q35-pcihost has a PCIBus type bus member, which is set to pcie.0 in q35_host_realize

The ICH9LPCState of ICH9-LPC has the isa_bus member of ISABus type, which is set to isa.0 when ich9_lpc_realize (the name is pieced together in qbus_realize)



#### Combination tree relationship

We know that both bus and device are essentially QOM objects. These objects are linked together in the form of paths to form a composite tree.

The info qom-tree is simplified (irq and memory-region are removed) as follows:

```
/machine (pc-q35-2.8-machine)
  /unattached (container)
    /device[2] (host-x86_64-cpu)
      / lapic (kvm-apic)
    /device[6] (ICH9-LPC)
      /isa.0 (ISA)
    /device[15] (i8042)
    /device[19] (i8257)
    /device[3] (host-x86_64-cpu)
      / lapic (kvm-apic)
    /device[7] (isa-i8259)
    /device[20] (i8257)
    /device[24] (ICH9 SMB)
      /i2c (i2c-bus)
    /device[8] (isa-i8259)
    /device[17] (vmmouse)
    /device[21] (ich9-ahci)
      /ide.4 (IDE)
      /ide.5 (IDE)
      /ide.0 (IDE)
      /ide.1 (IDE)
      /ide.2 (IDE)
      /ide.3 (IDE)
    /sysbus (System)
    /device[33] (VGA)
  /q35 (q35-pcihost)
    /pcie.0 (PCIE)
    /ioapic (ioapic)
    / mch (mch)
  /peripheral-anon (container)
  /peripheral (container)
```

This relationship is maintained through the child attribute.

main_system_bus_create created main-system-bus, and at the same time

```c
object_property_add_child(container_get(qdev_get_machine(), "/unattached"), "sysbus", OBJECT(main_system_bus), NULL);
```

And qdev_get_machine is defined as follows:

```c
Object *qdev_get_machine(void)
{
    static Object *dev;

    if (dev == NULL) {
        dev = container_get(object_get_root(), "/machine");
    }

    return dev;
}

Object *object_get_root(void)
{
    static Object *root;

    if (!root) {
        root = object_new("container");
    }

    return root;
}

Object *container_get(Object *root, const char *path)
{
    Object *obj, *child;
    gchar **parts;
    int i;

    // Split path
    parts = g_strsplit(path, "/", 0);
    assert(parts != NULL && parts[0] != NULL && !parts[0][0]);
    obj = root;

    // Step by step access, if you find that a certain level does not exist, create a container to fill it up
    for (i = 1; parts[i] != NULL; i++, obj = child) {
        child = object_resolve_path_component(obj, parts[i]);
        if (!child) {
            child = object_new("container");
            object_property_add_child(obj, parts[i], child, NULL);
        }
    }

    g_strfreev(parts);

    return obj;
}
```

First, qdev_get_machine calls container_get(object_get_root(), "/machine"), and object_get_root is responsible for returning the root-level object. If it is not created, it will create one and return. We can see that it is a container. According to its definition, we can find that it inherits Object, but does not define new members, which is equivalent to alias:

```c
static const TypeInfo container_info = {
    .name          = "container",
    .instance_size = sizeof(Object),
    .parent        = TYPE_OBJECT,
};
```


Then container_get is responsible for starting from the first parameter (root) passed in and returning the object whose relative path is the second parameter (path). It divides the relative path by "/" and calls object_resolve_path_component for each level

```c
Object *object_resolve_path_component(Object *parent, const gchar *part)
{
    ObjectProperty *prop = object_property_find(parent, part, NULL);
    if (prop == NULL) {
        return NULL;
    }

    if (prop->resolve) {
        return prop->resolve(parent, prop->opaque, part);
    } else {
        return NULL;
    }
}
```

Essentially, it looks for an attribute named pathname and returns its attribute value. The attribute value is the next level object on the path of the current level object, and then continue to call object_resolve_path_component from the next level object to find the next level object.

Iterate in this way until all the levels divided by the relative path are visited, and then return the last level object, which is the target object.

If a certain level of object does not exist, create a container, use it as the child attribute of the current level, and then continue to the next level.

Therefore, the path of main-system-bus is /machine/unattached/sysbus, which conforms to qom-tree. We can find the device object according to the path through object_resolve_path:

```
(gdb) p object_resolve_path("/machine/unattached/sysbus", 0)
$92 = (Object *) 0x555556769d20
(gdb) p object_resolve_path("/machine/unattached/sysbus", 0)->class->type->name
$93 = 0x555556683760 "System"
```

Similarly, after:

```c
object_property_add_child(qdev_get_machine(), "q35", OBJECT(q35_host), NULL);
object_property_add_child(object_resolve_path(parent_name, NULL), "ioapic", OBJECT(dev), NULL);
```

So the path of ioapic is /machine/q35/ioapic. Recall that ioapic and q35-pcihost are linked to the main-system-bus together, which is a level relationship. Obviously, there are inconsistencies between the mount relationship and the combination tree relationship.


For bus, qbus_realize => object_property_add_child(OBJECT(bus->parent), bus->name, OBJECT(bus), NULL) is added as the child attribute of the upper-level object, such as pcie.0 as q35 -pcihost's pcie.0 attribute, so the path is /machine/q35/pcie.0

For the memory region, memory_region_init => object_property_add_child is added as the child attribute of the upper-level object.




#### connection relation

In the combinatorial tree relationship, we can see that through the child attribute between devices, a device tree is formed, with the machine as the root, expanding downwards in categories. Through the path, we can start from the root device and iterate down one by one to find the target device.

But the combination tree cannot fully express the relationship between devices. In the child relationship, the parent node controls the life cycle of the child node. If we do not need such a strong relationship, but only need to indicate that one device is related to another device, how should we indicate it?

For this reason, QOM defines the backlink relationship. By setting the link attribute of the device, it means that a device refers to another device. After setting, a device can access another device through its link attribute, which also simulates the direct connection between two devices on the hardware Scenes.

One of the most typical backlinks is the bus and the child device plugged into it. The child device will have a link attribute pointing to the bus, such as:

pc_q35_init => qdev_create(NULL, TYPE_Q35_HOST_DEVICE) => qdev_try_create => object_new will call the instance function of its parent class, namely device_initfn, then:


```c
static void device_initfn(Object *obj)
{
    ...
    object_property_add_link(OBJECT(dev), "parent_bus", TYPE_BUS,
                             (Object **)&dev->parent_bus, NULL, 0,
                             &error_abort);
}
```

Set main-system-bus to the link attribute of q35-pcihost, named `parent_bus`. Note here that dev->parent_bus is still empty, because parent_bus has not been set until:

pc_q35_init => qdev_create(NULL, TYPE_Q35_HOST_DEVICE) => qdev_try_create => qdev_set_parent_bus `dev->parent_bus = bus;` will be filled in. Therefore, the attribute value is not the value of the object member, but the pointer of the object member. Of course, since the parent_bus member is originally a pointer, here is the pointer of the pointer (Object **).

Instead, bus will have a link attribute pointing to the child device:

In qdev_set_parent_bus, the next line of `dev->parent_bus = bus;` is bus_add_child:

```c
static void bus_add_child(BusState *bus, DeviceState *child)
{
    char name[32];
    BusChild *kid = g_malloc0(sizeof(*kid));

    kid->index = bus->max_index++;
    kid->child = child;
    object_ref(OBJECT(kid->child));

    QTAILQ_INSERT_HEAD(&bus->children, kid, sibling);

    /* This transfers ownership of kid->child to the property.  */
    snprintf(name, sizeof(name), "child[%d]", kid->index);
    object_property_add_link(OBJECT(bus), name,
                             object_get_typename(OBJECT(child)),
                             (Object **)&kid->child,
                             NULL, /* read-only property */
                             0, /* return ownership on prop deletion */
                             NULL);
}
```

It sets q35-pcihost device to the link attribute of main-system-bus, named `child[3]` (Note: the first three are kvmvapic, kvmclock and fw_cfg_io), and the value is the corresponding child in bus->children Address (pointer to pointer).

So the relationship between bus and device is related through two link attributes.


```
/machine (pc-q35-2.8-machine)
  /unattached (container)
    /sysbus (System) <------------------
                      -------          |
                            | child[3] | parent_bus
                      <------          |
  /q35 (q35-pcihost) -------------------
    /pcie.0 (PCIE)
    /ioapic (ioapic)
    / mch (mch)
```

If the relationship between devices is a tree, then the relationship between devices becomes a directed graph after adding backlinks.

So we can access q35-pcihost through the path /machine/unattached/sysbus/child[3]:

```
(gdb) p object_resolve_path("/machine/unattached/sysbus/child[3]", 0)
$95 = (Object *) 0x55555694ec00
(gdb) p object_resolve_path("/machine/unattached/sysbus/child[3]", 0)->class->type->name
$96 = 0x555556690ae0 "q35-pcihost"
```

And the path can be rewound, so there is this gameplay:

```
(gdb) p object_resolve_path("/machine/unattached/sysbus", 0)
$97 = (Object *) 0x555556769d20
(gdb) p object_resolve_path("/machine/unattached/sysbus/child[3]/parent_bus", 0)
$98 = (Object *) 0x555556769d20
(gdb) p object_resolve_path("/machine/unattached/sysbus/child[3]/parent_bus/child[3]/parent_bus", 0)
$99 = (Object *) 0x555556769d20
(gdb) p object_resolve_path("/machine/unattached/sysbus/child[3]/parent_bus/child[3]/parent_bus/child[3]/parent_bus", 0)
$100 = (Object *) 0x555556769d20
...
```



### to sum up
This article outlines the composition of the "newest" q35 architecture in QEMU, and also analyzes the relationship between the devices.

Next, I will study the simulation of devices in QEMU, including interrupt controller PIC, IOAPIC, and how interrupts are transferred and routed between devices.
